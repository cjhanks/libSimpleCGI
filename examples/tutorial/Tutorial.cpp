  //
  //    When set:
  //      `config.childCount` is meaningless.
  //
  //  THREADED:
  //    Creates a pool of reusable `config.childCount` threads. Note that
  //    there is always `config.childCount + 1` threads.  This is because
  //    one thread is exclusively responsible for `accept` calls on the
  //    socket and may be used in various background tasks.
  //
  //    Threads are *not* detached from the main process.  Abort calls in
  //    any thread will terminate all threads.
  //
  //    Important:
  //      Child sockets are passed through a thread-safe blocking queue.
  //      This queue can theoretically overflow, it is expected that
  //      queuing is performed in the downstream FastCGI provider.
  //
  //  PREFORKED:
  //    There are `config.childCount + 1` processes.  The main process
  //    is responsible for accepting sockets and sending them to children
  //    in different processes.
  //
  //    Crashes in the main thread will cause an abort of all children,
  //    connections will not be drained.
  //
  //    Crashes in child threads will be restarted by main thread.
